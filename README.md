# Instructions

A. Write the SQL statements in order to create the tables for the database. Use the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the database shown in Figure 1. For simplicity, we are assuming in this project that a book cannot be written by more than one author. You need to create the tables as well as the required constraints, including the keys (primary and foreign), and the relationships between tables.

B. Populate your database with the sample set of data given to you in the tables below the assignment prompts.

C. Write the following queries to retrieve the information detailed below.

    Display all contents of the Clients table
    First names, last names, ages and occupations of all clients
    First and last names of clients that borrowed books in March 2018
    First and last names of the top 5 authors clients borrowed in 2017
    Nationalities of the least 5 authors that clients borrowed during the years 2015-2017
    The book that was most borrowed during the years 2015-2017
    Top borrowed genres for client born in years 1970-1980
    Top 5 occupations that borrowed the most in 2016
    Average number of borrowed books by job title
    Create a VIEW and display the titles that were borrowed by at least 20% of clients
    The top month of borrows in 2017
    Average number of borrows by age
    The oldest and the youngest clients of the library
    First and last names of authors that wrote books in more than one genre

As you work on these queries, create indexes that will increase your queries' performance.

You must include comments in your code that address the purpose of your query and explains each step. Save your queries and results in a plain-text file that you will submit as your assignment.
